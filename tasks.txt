1. add docstrings to your functions which describe what the variables are that are the inputs, and what the output is

2. compute an error measure between the true partition function of this small Ising model and the partition function estimation found by Wang Landau.

3. x-axis: Wang Landau iteration. y-axis: Z* (estimate of the partition function). Then plot, as the wang landau algorithm progresses, what the current partition function estimate is as a function of the iteration index.
